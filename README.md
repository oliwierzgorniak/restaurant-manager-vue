# Restauran manager

This is a rebuilt of my [previous project](https://github.com/oliwierzgorniak/restaurant-managment) written in react. This time I chose Vue.js in order to prepare my self to give a presenation to the class about it. I focused on mechanics abandoning visual aspects. I intentionally avoided state managment libraries to get a better grasp of the native state managment solutions.
